Sir/Madam,

Sub: Transaction in Corporate Bonds through Request for Quote (RFQ) platform by Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs)

1.	To increase the liquidity on RFQ platform of stock exchanges and to enhance the transparency and disclosure pertaining to trading in secondary market in Corporate Bonds, SEBI has, in past, prescribed stipulations for transactions on RFQ platform by Mutual Funds1, Portfolio Management Services2 and Stock Brokers3.
2.	Considering the above and taking into account the recommendations of the Alternative Investment Policy Advisory Committee (AIPAC), it is stipulated that AIFs shall undertake at least 10% of their total secondary market trades in Corporate Bonds by value in a month by placing/seeking quotes on the RFQ platform.

3.	Further, in terms of SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/DDHS_Div1/P/CIR/2022/142 dated October 19, 2022, quotes on RFQ platform can be placed to an identified counterparty (i.e. ‘one-to-one’ mode) or to all the participants (i.e. ‘one-to-many’ mode). In this regard, it is clarified that all transactions in Corporate Bonds wherein AIF(s) is on both sides of the trade shall be executed through RFQ platform in ‘one-to-one’ mode. However, any transaction entered by an AIF in Corporate Bonds in ‘one-to-many’ mode which gets executed with another AIF, shall be counted in ‘one-to-many’ mode and not in ‘one-to-one’ mode.
